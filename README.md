##Inforamtion
if you want to submit an issue, read [the guidelines](https://github.com/Johnsmith0508/misc-add/wiki/Guidelines-for-submiting-an-issue) on submiting an issue first.

##Building yourself
this is rather unnesisary, given that the mod is build automaticly on the [jenkins build](http://75.115.0.158) server. if you still want to build yourself, visit the [mod website](http://johnsmith0508.github.io/misc-add/)

## Recipes

now located at the [wiki](https://github.com/Johnsmith0508/misc-add/wiki)

##Permisions
most modpacks require permisions from the author in order to include them in a pack. At the current point in time, I request that you private message me on either [minecraft forums](http://google.com) or on the [FTB Forums](http://google.com). most likely, it will be aproved, except under rare circumstances. please __DO NOT__ request permision to use an experamental build in a pack, it will be denied.
